- 👋 Hi, I’m @jenurias
- 👀 I’m interested in all puppy content, basketball, and exploring new things and places. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end web development. Our current language is JavaScript and also working on my first repository commit. I'm sure there will be plenty more to come, which is exciting. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects related to e-commerce websites (shopify, etc.)
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me directly at jenniferurias365@gmail.com.
